Specimens of cryptogams were collected from various localities (Gadyahra, Gadohal, Bidi, Parchu, Balh, Ratkel, Tasli nala, Sarkaghat, Barchwar, Longani and Dhagwani) of Sarkaghat region with the help of equipments like knife, spatula, trowel, forceps and also by hands. The specimens were initially stored in containers, plastic bags and paper packets. Field data was recorded in field note book including locality name, collection date and substratum. The specimens were pressed, dried and identified with the help of identification keys and latest literature. During the present investigations, a total of 63 species of cryptogams of families Zygnemataceae, Ulothriaceae, Hydrodictyaceae, Cladophoraceae, Tabellariaceae, Marchantiaceae, Aytoniaceae, Bryaceae, Anthocerotaceae, Funariaceae, Hypnaceae, Polytrichaceae, Fissidentaceae, Candelariaceae, Verrucariaceae, Cladoniaceae, Parmeliaceae, Physciaceae, Calicariaceae, Graphidaceae, Lecanoraceae, Pteridaceae, Aspleniaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Equisetaceae, Athyriaceae, Marseliaceae, Selaginellaceae, Thelypteridaceae, Cheilanthaceae, Lygodiaceae and Polypodiaceae had been identified.<\/p>","abstractlink":"floristic-studies-on-cryptogams-of-sarkaghat-region-in-himachalrnpradesh-india-64260.html","pdflink":"https://www.eresearchco.com/articles/floristic-studies-on-cryptogams-of-sarkaghat-region-in-himachalpradesh-india.pdf","fulltextlink":null,"spage_num":"22","lpage_num":"36","doi_num":"","doi_stat":"0","art_type":"Research Article","rel_keyword":"articles","year":"2020","jshort_name":"J.
